                "Figure 3. After sorting the light curves as quiet or variable, Planet Hunters will be asked if there are any possible transits in the data. If low points are seen, then answer 'yes' and click on the icon to create a box that can be positioned over the transit features."
             data04b:
                "A special orientation of the orbit is required. Because the technique looks for a dimming in the brightness of the star, all of the planets with orbits that don’t pass between the star and our line of sight will be missed."
             data03a:
                "The project's Principal Investigator, Bill Borucki, began planning the Kepler mission in the mid-1980's and his team has been hard at work for more than a decade. To reward them for this hard work, the Kepler team has advanced access to the light curves. We at Planet Hunters are not part of the NASA Kepler team. However, NASA is releasing light curves into the public archive to encourage broader participation and we think that the public can play an important role as our scientific partners in this latest Zooniverse project"
             data04c:
                "Close-in planets are easier to detect. A transit event only occurs once per orbit; planets that are closer to their host stars race around their orbits faster than planets that orbit at larger distances. To confidently detect a transit, at least three dips in the brightness (i.e., three transit events) must occur. Thus, a planet that orbits in one year, like the Earth, requires three years of data for detection, while planets that orbit in ten days can be detected with just thirty days of data. "
             data02a:
                "The time series of brightness measurements for a star is called a light curve. The Kepler spacecraft beams data for more than 150,000 stars to Earth at regular intervals. With every download of data, the time baseline of the light curves is extended."
             transits01a:
                "However, the real treasure hunt is for transiting planets and these present as a relatively sharp dip in brightness in the light curve (Figure 3). A transit could appear in either a quiet or a variable curve. Indeed, it will be more difficult for computer algorithms to find transits imposed on the variable light curves, so we hope that Planet Hunters will pay particular attention to these."
             data04d:
                "Larger planets are easier to detect. The bigger the planet, the more starlight it blocks out. The Kepler mission measures the brightness of stars with such incredible precision that it is sensitive enough to detect transits of planets approaching the size of Earth."
             data01a:
                "On March 2009, the NASA Kepler mission was launched with the goal of using the transit technique to detect exoplanets: terrestrial and larger planets orbiting other stars. With this method, planets that pass in front of their host stars block out some of the starlight causing the star to dim slightly for a few hours. The Kepler spacecraft stares at a field of stars in the Cygnus constellation and records the brightness of those stars every thirty minutes to search for transiting planets."
             morelightcurves03a:
                "You may notice there are gaps in some sections of the light curves. These gaps in the data are typically due to the Kepler spacecraft not observing. The gaps are caused by a few different things: Kepler went into safe mode and wasn’t taking data, the spacecraft was rotating towards the Earth to send the data back to NASA, the spacecraft has executing a roll (or quarterly roll as its called) to reorient its solar panels, or the data quality is bad typically due to a cosmic ray hit on the detector."

The reason we don’t identify the simulated data first, is that if you knew the lightcurve had simulated events you might look at it differently. To be able to use the data from the simulated transits accurately, we need them to be examined in exactly the same conditions as the real lightcurves."

When we look at a light curve, we're seeing how the brightness changes with time. In the Figure below, there are starspots in addition to the transiting planet (lower left spot on the star). However, starspots rotate with the star and cause relatively slow changes in the brightness of the star. Transiting planets cross the star in hours and cause quick dips in the brightness of the star. Look below to see the difference (left image). Spots cause most of the smooth and slowly varying brightness and we're learning that many stars have much larger spots than the Sun."

This is a really vital part of the project, with these simulated transits we can answer these really interesting and fundamental questions about how solar systems and planets form. Some of the simulated planets like large Jupiter-sized planets will be really easy to spot while others will be near impossible to identify especially for the extremely small planets, but don’t be discouraged if you didn’t find the simulated transit.

We now have the first ~120 days of the Kepler science mission to search through. We have chosen to show sections of the light curve that are the same size as the first quarter (35 days), and therefore Quarter 2 light curves are broken into three sections.

If this event has not been identified and several Planet Hunters are flagging the same data, the science team will investigate. If this appears to be a new discovery, then we will follow up to obtain spectroscopic data using the Keck telescope in Hawaii.

Other light curves, like those in Figure 2, are obviously variable with time. We think that most of the variability (on timescales of hours to days) is caused by starspots or pulsations.

Don't worry if some of them seem too easy, they should, as big planets with short-period orbits around small stars should produce a clear signal. Similarly, you may run into simulations that seem difficult or downright impossible to detect. Don't despair though, finding small planets is hard. Both easy and nigh-impossible simulated transits are important in order to find out what kind of planets the project is good at detecting and what planets are harder to find.

These data consist of brightness measurements, or "light curves," taken every thirty minutes for more than 150,000 stars. Users search for possible transit events - a brief dip in brightness that occurs when a planet passes in front of the star - with the goal of discovering a planet (hence the name "Planet Hunters").
The most difficult detections for Planet Hunters and for computer-based searches will be those from planets that orbit far from their star and therefore cross the star infrequently.  It may also be difficult for computer algorithms to detect planets in data that has artificial offsets (which can occur with telescope pointing errors or space craft rolls). Planet Hunter participants may be better than computers at finding signals in this type of data. Because of the outstanding pattern recognition of the human brain, we hope that participants will also establish new "families" or classifications for the light curves. We will be standing by to obtain more data at telescopes to better understand the underlying physical reason for the different classifications.

So, astronomers often resort to looking at the effect a planet has on its star, and inferring the presence of an unseen planet. There are two ways to do this: 1) the Doppler technique, which measures the changing velocity of the star, and 2) astrometry, which measures the changing position of the star in the plane of the sky.
When a planet’s orbit crosses our line of sight to the star, the star is partially eclipsed. This causes a brief dip in how bright the star looks to us.  This is called the transit technique, and it is the method that Planet Hunters uses. If scientists know the precise transit times, they can also infer the presence of additional planets in the system.
Another successful technique is called microlensing. This is a gravitational focusing of light from a background source by a star and planet that pass between our line of sight.

                        "Hard to say!  Almost all exoplanets discovered so far have been detected through an indirect method, where we observe changes in the light coming from the planet's parent stars, not the planets themselves. For transiting planets, which is what Kepler detects, the planet passes between the Earth and the parent star, blocking a small amount of light that we would have otherwise detected. This dip in light is how we infer the presence of the planet. But you can see an artist's rendition of this happening, here:"

                        """The light curve shows changes in the brightness of the star over time. These changes can occur because of star spots that rotate on the surface of the star, which typically show cycles of days, weeks or months and can also come and go. Sometimes the brightness of the star changes because the star expands or contracts.
Of most interest to Planet Hunters is when a planet passes in front of a star and blocks out some of the starlight, causing a temporary dimming that lasts for one to several hours. This dimming is absolutely periodic - it does not come and go. The amount of dimming depends on the size of the planet.

                        "Planets don't give off their own light, so a planet that moves in front of its host star blocks out some fraction of the light from the star. The bigger the planet, the more starlight it blocks out - so the magnitude of the decrease in starlight reveals the size of the planet. Knowing the size and mass of the planet immediately tells scientists the density of the planet, so we can figure out whether the planet is a low density gas giant or a small rocky planet. Together with information about the distance of the planet from the star, the density is important for determining whether the planet has the potential to be a habitable world. "

Because our Sun rotates, the spots rotate too, and the brightness of the Sun varies because the number and size of the spots vary. In addition, our Sun pulses slightly with a 5 minute cycle. During these pulsations, the brightness changes ever so slightly. Other stars also change their brightness and the amount of change and the timescale for these variations can be quite different from the Sun. With the NASA Kepler mission data, we have the remarkable precision to see brightness changes at a level that has never before been recorded."
